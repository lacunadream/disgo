# DO
React-native android app - Do!

A simple react-native app written for our entry to Masters of Code London 2015. 
The concept of the app is that whenever you feel like donating to a good cause of your choice, you can hit the 'Do It' button and a random amount of small change will deducted from your available credits. 

Utilises react-native, Node.JS, and MasterCard's Simplify API. 

Getting the environment set up in Linux and Windows was quite a pain. 
Chrome debugger does not work on Windows, and @mrsaints had to do some amazing coding just to get facebook login to work (still no sdk for react-native android)
Ended up with quite a few static pages, but was a fun app building experience!


Made it to the finals of the hackathon (top 6)
